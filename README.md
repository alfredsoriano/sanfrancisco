# CSCE A462 Assignment 1
## Alfred Soriano

This assignment looks at San Francisco data in order to help the city in some way.
The dataset I looked at is the Graffiti dataset from `https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Graffiti/vg6y-3pcr/about_data`

I use Google Colab which by default already has many python libraries installed.
However if you prefer to not use Colab, the libraries needed are:
```
pandas
mlxtend
scikit-learn
folium
```
