# CSCE A462 Assignment 1
## Alfred Soriano

This assignment looks at San Francisco data in order to help the city in some way.
The dataset I looked at is the Graffiti dataset from `https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Graffiti/vg6y-3pcr/about_data`

I use Google Colab which by default already has many python libraries installed.
However if you prefer to not use Colab, the libraries needed are:
```
pandas
mlxtend
scikit-learn
folium
```

## Installation

You would just need to clone the this using 
```
git clone https://github.com/alfredsoriano/sanfrancisco.git
```

This contains the .ipynb file (the Google Colab Notebook file), which you can then open in either
Google Colab or VSCode.
